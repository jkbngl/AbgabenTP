									<p style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">The book is about a police officer that wants to take a few days of his stressful work and books a luxurious vacation in Yorkshire. However, his vacation wasn’t very relaxing, because just a few days into his trip he discovers a floating dead body in the pool. He can’t resist his instinct and begins his investigations. Even though he is struggling a bit with the local police who won’t let him help them because he is not responsible for his case he helps them. A few days later a second dead body is found and the investigations start getting more intense. With the time there come more and more information to the case, like for example, affairs, children that are born by other people and not by the mother who raised them, our main character falls in love with another women who also attends the case. </p>

								<div class="content span-7">
									<h2 class="major" style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">Main Topics</h2>
									<p  style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">The book is clichéd, it follows a topic you hear in tons of books and films, the main topic consists of a police officer that takes a few days off from his stressful job and encounters a new case, a murder, in his vacation, he then starts investigating on his own. He encounters a police officer which he doesn’t get along well at all and a female police he starts liking a lot. Over all the book is crime novell but also has some parts of love, hate and adventure in it.</p>
