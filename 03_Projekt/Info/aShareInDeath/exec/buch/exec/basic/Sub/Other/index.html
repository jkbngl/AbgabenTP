								<h3>Writing Style</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The book is written very complicated, with a lot of descriptions and complicated links between the book. The context of the book might be a bit complicated to get for everybody, so I would recommend the book for more experienced readers. </p>

								<h3>Genre</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The book is classified as a Fiction, Mystery and Supspense book, I would also recommend classifying it as a crime and love book, because I think this two themes take up a lot of space in the book.</p>

								<h3>Social Context</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The book plays mostly in a social context similar to most people, even though the place where Kincaid goes for his vacation is described as luxurious the people and also the ambience doesn’t some incredible luxurious.</p>

								<h3>Linguistic Aspect</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The book follows a complicated style, but not through the hole book, you can clearly see when important parts of the book happen, the language of the books becomes easier, so that everyone understands it.</p>

								<h3>My recession</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The book is full of interesting networked information, which with the time start to make sense, and you can clearly see that the author had an idea what she is writing and not just wrote whatever came into her mind.
                            The book is also full of interesting quotes like for example: “Excuses sound like what they are”, which I personally think is true, it might seem like a stupid quote but I personally found it very interesting.
                            The book is, in my opinion, also full of beautiful descriptions, which make the book much more interesting, because you can clearly see the picture, which the author tries to describe in the book, pop up into your head.
                            Like for example: “She continued rubbing her hair with a towel and it stuck up in dark spikes, which made her look oddly young.”
                            But also not everything was good about the book, it was pretty hard to follow in some  parts because there were a lot of changes of people, and in the middle the book also became a bit boring to read because there was not really happening a lot and there were just boring descriptions about the investigations.
                            Summarized, I enjoyed the book, in some parts it was a bit boring to read, but other very interesting parts made up for that.</p>

							<p>A week's holiday in a luxurious Yorkshire time-share is just what Scotland Yard's Superintendent Duncan Kincaid needs. But the discovery of a body floating in the whirlpool bath ends Kincaid's vacation before it's begun. One of his new acquaintances at Followdale House is dead; another is a killer. Despite a distinct lack of cooperation from the local constabulary, Kincaid's keen sense of duty won't allow him to ignore the heinous crime, impelling him to send for his enthusiastic young assistant, Sergeant Gemma James. But the stakes are raised dramatically when a second murder occurs, and Kincaid and James find themselves in a determined hunt for a fiendish felon who enjoys homicide a bit too much.</p>

								<h3>Recession: Publishers Weekly</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This polished mystery seems more the work of a seasoned genre master than the first novel it is. Det. Supt. Duncan Kincaid, spending his vacation from Scotland Yard at a Yorkshire time-share along with several other guests, finds his holiday anything but relaxing. Immediately after he arrives at the elegant estate, he overhears a heated argument between the snobbish caretaker and her sarcastic assistant manager. Late that evening, the assistant is electrocuted in the Jacuzzi. To the consternation of Yorkshire police, Kincaid assumes an active role in the investigation, which becomes more urgent after two more deaths. Meanwhile, Sgt. Gemma James, a pragmatic single mother charmed by Kincaid's unpretentious demeanor and bachelor status, digs for additional clues in London. Crombie, a Texan, has written a convincingly British whodunit, limning Kincaid and James with the ease and authority of one who has already completed several installments in a series. Readers will surely welcome follow-up appearances.</p>
